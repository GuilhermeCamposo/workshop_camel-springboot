= Lab 3 - REST and Database

Learn how to expose a REST endpoint and how to connect to databases using Camel.

REST is key when we talk about integration.
In this lab, we are going to explore some basic REST integrations with Red Hat Fuse (Camel) interacting with a SQL database.

We are going to work on 3 REST JSON endpoints:

* `GET /orders`
** Retrieve all orders from a database
* `GET /orders/{id}`
** Retrieve a specific order by id
* `POST /orders`
** CREATE a order in an async way

Patterns/components covered during this lab:

* REST
* Swagger Generation
* Database
* Wiretap (Async process)
* Messaging

== Creating REST endpoints

Let's create the endpoints needed for this lab.

Open `RestRouter.java`. Inside the `configure()` method, declare our first REST endpoint.

=== Get all orders (GET)

In the `RestRouter.java` copy the following code and paste it over `// insert your rest code here`.

[source,java]
----
rest("/orders")
    .get("/")
        .route()
        .log("Getting all order entries from database")
        .endRest();
----

{empty} +

Run the integration and access the preview endpoint as shown in your CodeReady Workspaces (append `/camel/orders` to it) terminal.

Every time you hit the HTTP endpoint the message *"getting all orders entries from database"* should appear in the log.
It doesn't return anything yet because nothing was implemented to return to the caller.
For now, don't worry about it. Open the web page using the following button on the right menu.

image::./images/open-web.png[]

{empty} +

Or, using the Preview tool.

image::./images/open-preview.png[]

{empty} +

[type=verification]
Do you see the message *"Getting all order entries from database"* in the logs every time you hit the `/camel/orders` HTTP endpoint?

=== Get order by ID (GET)

Observe how we declare the path parameter ID on the URL on this new route. Copy this code and paste it before the `;` in the route:

[source,java]
----
.get("/{id}")
    .route()
    .log("Getting order with id ${header.id} entry from database")
    .endRest();
----

{empty} +

Run the integration again and access the page in the browser as before, except use the URI path `/camel/orders/1`.

[type=verification]
Do you see the message *"Getting order with id 1 entry from database"* in the logs every time you hit the `/camel/orders/1` endpoint?

=== Create a new order (POST)

Now we will implement the same path as before (`/`) but using the HTTP verb POST.

[source,java]
----
    .post("/").type(Order.class)
        .route()
        .log("Order ${body.description} received")
        .endRest();
----

{empty} +

The entire REST definition should look like this:

[source,java]
----
rest("/orders")
    .get("/")
        .route()
        .log("geting all orders entries from database")
        .endRest()

    .get("/{id}")
        .route()
        .log("geting order with id ${header.id} entry from database")
        .endRest()

    .post("/").type(Order.class)
        .route()
        .log("Order ${body.description} received")
        .endRest();
----

{empty} +

Here is the method:

image::./images/lab03-rest-definition.png[]

{empty} +

Run the application again.
This time let's check the swagger definition.
You can access it by opening the preview page and clicking in the `API Swagger Page` button.

{empty} +

image::./images/web-page-swaggerui.png[]

{empty} +

* Expand the *POST /orders/* section
* Click *Try it out*
* In the body, paste in the following JSON & click *Execute*

{empty} +

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "item": "Red Hat Fuse Workshop",
    "amount": 2,
    "description": "Workshop to explore Fuse on springboot",
    "processed": true
}
----

{empty} +

[type=verification]
Do you see the message *"Order Workshop to explore Fuse on Spring Boot received"* in the logs every time you hit the `/camel/orders` HTTP (POST) endpoint?

[time=5]
== Rest Documentation

The Open API Specification(aka Swagger) is being auto-generated. Open the browser to the `/camel/api-doc` endpoint.

image::./images/lab03-api-doc.png[]

{empty} +

If you prefer to see it in a human-readable way, check through the swagger-UI interface with the `/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/camel/api-doc` endpoint.

image::./images/lab03-swagger.png[]

{empty} +

You can enrich the documentation adding some descriptions in your code, let's do it:

[source,java]
----
rest("/orders").description("Orders CRUD REST endpoint")
    .get("/").description("Get all orders")
        .route().routeId("all-orders")
        .log("Getting all order entries from database")
        .endRest()
    .get("/{id}").description("Get orders by id")
        .route().routeId("find-by-id")
        .log("Getting order with id ${header.id} entry from database")
        .endRest()
    .post("/").type(Order.class).description("Create a new order")
        .route().routeId("create order")
        .log("Order received")
        .endRest();
----

{empty} +

The Swagger page will look like this:

image::./images/lab03-swagger-documented.png[]

{empty} +

[type=verification]
Have you been able to access the interface from SwaggerUI? Do you see the updated documentation?

[time=5]
== Boilerplate code

In `RestSetup.java` we use the `restConfiguration()` method to specify everything about the REST server and swagger doc:

[source,java]
----
restConfiguration()
    .apiContextPath("/api-doc")
    .apiProperty("api.title", "Greeting REST API")
    .apiProperty("api.version", "1.0")
    .apiProperty("cors", "true")
    .apiProperty("base.path", "camel/")
    .apiProperty("api.path", "/")
    .apiProperty("host", "")
    .apiContextRouteId("doc-api")
.component("servlet")
.bindingMode(RestBindingMode.json);
----

{empty} +

Also, some dependencies are needed in `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- Swagger UI -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
    <artifactId>swagger-ui</artifactId>
    <version>3.13.0</version>
</dependency>
<!-- REST -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
<!-- WEB SERVER -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-undertow</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

{empty} +

[time=15]
== Database

Now we have the REST endpoints but it doesn't do anything until we tie it with some kind of back-end data store.
Let's work on the interaction with the orders database to retrieve relevant order information.
For this we will use the link:https://camel.apache.org/sql.html[camel-SQL, window="_blank"] component to do it.

Interacting with a database is a common need, so it's important to see how simple it is with Camel.

We will continue to work with the same REST resources but adding database interactions to get the orders available and create new ones.

=== Interacting with databases

There are three strings (*selectAll*, *selectById*, *insertOrder*) already defined in the `RestRouter` class to retrieve/create information from a database that we will use on the REST DSL to interact with database.

Before starting, include the databases dependencies necessary in the `pom.xml` file.
You can do it by uncommenting the `database section`. In this lab you will be using an embedded database, so don't worry about any installation process.

image::./images/database-session-pom.png[]

{empty} +

=== GET all and by ID

Replace the `get()` methods with the following code:

[source,java]
----
.get("/").description("Get all orders")
    .route().routeId("all-orders")
    .log("Getting all order entries from database")
    .to(this.selectAll)
    .endRest()

.get("/{id}").description("Get orders by id")
    .route().routeId("find-by-id")
    .log("Getting order with id ${header.id} entry from database")
    .to(this.selectById)
    .endRest()
----

{empty} +

Run the integration and invoke the REST endpoints using the swagger-ui interface:

- `/camel/orders`
- `/camel/orders/1`

{empty} +

The response should look like this:

image::./images/lab03-orders-from-database01.png[]

{empty} +

[type=verification]
Are you seeing the Orders from the database now?

{empty} +

The file `src/main/resources/schema.sql` was created to populate the database during the startup. Open it and take a look.

=== Create a new Order (POST)

Now replace the `post()` method with the following code:

[source,java]
----
.post("/").type(Order.class).description("Create a new order")
    .route().routeId("create order")
    .log("Order received")
    .to(this.insertOrder)
    .endRest();
----

{empty} +

Run the integration and make a POST request to `/camel/orders` with the following body:

[source,json]
----
{
    "item": "Red Hat Fuse Workshop",
    "amount": 2,
    "description": "Workshop to explore Fuse on springboot",
    "processed": true
}
----

{empty} +

[type=verification]
Execute the get all Orders again. Do you see the new order that you just created?

[time=3]
== Boilerplate code

To make it all work, the following dependencies were added to the project's `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hsqldb</groupId>
    <artifactId>hsqldb</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-sql-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

{empty} +

For every different database you want to support, you need to add the equivalent driver dependency. For example, if you need to interact with MySQL, you must add:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

== Summary

Congratulations, you finished the REST and Databases lab.

We covered a lot of things during this lab. Here's a quick recap:

* Defining REST endpoints
* Interacting with a database using the SQL component
* Auto generating API docs (Swagger)

You can now proceed to `Messaging`.
