= Lab 0 - Workshop Introduction

Learn how to set up your environment and tools available for this workshop.

Welcome to the Fuse workshop! It's a pleasure to guide you on this hands-on experience.

This workshop aims to offer you practical experience with Red Hat Fuse. It is not meant to be a complete training of Red Hat Fuse. For this purpose we have an amazing https://www.redhat.com/pt-br/services/training/jb421-red-hat-jboss-fuse-camel-development[official training], covering many aspects of Red Hat Fuse in depth.

The main objective is to cover as many Fuse aspects during this workshop. We will be using a https://github.com/GuilhermeCamposo/fuse-workshop.git[project skeleton] during this lab.

This *fuse-workshop* project is a Red Hat Fuse (aka https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel]) Spring Boot project, with some code already written for you. It will help you focus on what really matters rather than having you write lots of boilerplate code.

== Requirements

=== Knowledge Requirements

We prepared this content in a way that anyone can execute the labs and get an understanding of what is happening and the desired outcomes.
Although for a better and deeper experience, so previous knowledge is require:

- Basic Java
- Basic Maven

=== Tools Requirements

- You won't need any specific tool installed in your workstation. We only require an updated web browser, preferably Chrome or Firefox.

== Setup CodeReady Workspaces

These walkthroughs use link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview[CodeReady Workspaces, window="_blank"] (based on https://www.eclipse.org/che[Eclipse Che]).
It's an IDE on the cloud based on containers. You can also use a local development environment if you'd prefer (i.e. https://code.visualstudio.com[Visual Studio Code], https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview[Red Hat CodeReady Studio] (formerly known as JBoss Developer Studio), https://www.jetbrains.com/idea[IntelliJ IDEA], etc).

As this is a web application, we are going to explore it in future labs, CodeReady Workspaces will suggest to you to open a link. Click on `Open Link`.

In the end you should see a web app on the side menu, and a `hello router` message in the logs.
